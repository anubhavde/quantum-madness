### **Cirq**

An open source framework for programming quantum computers

[Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) is a Python software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits, and then running them on quantum computers and quantum simulators. Cirq provides useful abstractions for dealing with todayâ€™s noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, where details of the hardware are vital to achieving state-of-the-art results.

Install ```cirq``` using ```pip```:
```console
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install cirq
```

Some optional dependencies of features in ```cirq.contrib```:
```console
python -m pip install cirq-core[contrib]
```

System dependancies that pip can't handle:
```console
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base latexmk
```
